# Exam Online System Frontend

## Introduction

This is the frontend of the Exam Online System. It is based on the [vue-admin-template](https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-admin-template) template.

The backend of the system is written in Python using the Django framework. The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/vanhung4499/exam-online-system-be).

The system is designed to be used by schools or organizations to conduct online exams. It supports multiple types of questions, random exam generation, and exam statistics.

In the future, I plan to build a school management system that includes more features like attendance, timetable, and grade, file management.

## Technologies
